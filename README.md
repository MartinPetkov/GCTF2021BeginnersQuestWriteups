# Google CTF 2021 - Beginners Quest Writeups

This repository contains writeups for my solutions to all the challenges in the [Google CTF 2021 Beginners Quest](https://capturetheflag.withgoogle.com/beginners-quest). The CTF took place on August 27-29 2021 and consisted of 18 challenges ranging in type from coding, reversing, web exploitation, pwn, data parsing, steganography, and more.

**I highly encourage you try to solve the challenges yourself before reading the solutions here**, or use them sparingly to get unstuck. This is the best way to learn, especially with topics you are new to and unfamiliar with. I certainly am not an expert in all categories and learned a great deal from this CTF.

## Structure

There's one folder for each challenge. There I include all relevant files that you receive as a participant, a step-by-step writeup of how I solved it, a solve script (where feasible), and finally the flag itself. I also try to describe my intuition and how one might approach this kind of problem, as I feel that this is the key skill that CTFs help you develop.

Each challenge also has a story, which I include at the beginning. The story is very loose but it does at times gives hints about how to solve the challenge.

## Disclaimers

Depending on when you read this post, the servers may still be up and verifying flags, as there was no official end date. But most likely they'll be down. However, several challenges are solvable offline and you can verify with the flags in the repo, even without the server.

I received a lot of help and helpful nudges by people in the [official Discord channel](https://discord.com/channels/856899439833382935/880198649999683585). Huge thank you to everyone who helpd me through and did your best not to just give the answer away!
