# Google CTF 2021 - Beginners Quest Writeups

This repository contains writeups for my solutions to all the challenges in the [Google CTF 2021 Beginners Quest](https://capturetheflag.withgoogle.com/beginners-quest). The CTF took place on August 27-29 2021 and consisted of 18 challenges ranging in type from coding, reversing, web exploitation, pwn, data parsing, steganography, and more.

**I highly encourage you try to solve the challenges yourself before reading the solutions here**, or use them sparingly to get unstuck. This is the best way to learn, especially with topics you are new to and unfamiliar with. I certainly am not an expert in all categories and I learned a great deal from this CTF.

## Structure

There's one folder for each challenge. There you'll find:

* The "story" for that challenge, which is very loose but does at times give useful hints;
* All relevant files that you receive as a participant;
* A step-by-step writeup of how I solved the challeng;
* A solve script, where feasible;
* And finally, the flag itself.

I also try to describe the intuition and how one might approach this kind of problem, as I feel that this is the key skill that CTFs help you develop.

## Disclaimers

For all challenges I used Chrome and Debian Linux.

Depending on when you read this post, the servers may still be up and verifying flags, as there was no official end date. If they're down, you can still solve several challenges offline and verify with the flags in the repo.

I received a lot of help and nudges from people in the [official Discord channel](https://discord.com/channels/856899439833382935/880198649999683585). Huge thank you to everyone who helped me through and did your best not to just give the answer away!
