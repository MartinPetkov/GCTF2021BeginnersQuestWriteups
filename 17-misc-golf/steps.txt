- Remove the shell directive at the top
- Remove __all__ directive at the  top
- Convert to single-spaced indentation
- Convert NUMBERS to uses a prime numbers generator, taken from https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/a/70027
- Convert "output = ...; output.append" lines into list comprehensions
- Reduce function calls across multiple lines into one line
- Combine the step1 and step2 functions
- Convert all the struct packing functions to just byte addition
- Convert the byte generation for the 3 blocks into the final bytes
- Use zip() instead of enumerate to xor the data blocks with the primes
- Use a cheaper primes generator like https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/a/6297
- Convert the 'a..z' to a variable and reuse it with .upper()
- Convert the '\x00\x00\x00\x1a' to a variable and reuse it
- Move the bytes to list comprehension directly instead of saving it in a variable
- Rename "range" to a single character
- Move the def to a single line with semicolons
- Remove the [] in the call to bytes()
- Combine byte sequence with \x00 and a-z, .upper() on the combination doesn't affect the first 4 bytes
- Rename all functions and variables to single characters
- Remove all blank lines
- Remove all newlines where syntactically possible
- Remove all spaces  where syntactically possible
- Put through a minifier like https://python-minifier.com/
- Success!
