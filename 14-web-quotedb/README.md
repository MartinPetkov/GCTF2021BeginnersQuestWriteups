## Story

>You don’t manage to disarm the guard, he is quicker than you are. He knocks you out, and when you wake up you’re inside a prison cell, but it doesn’t seem like you’re on a boat anymore, you must be inside the headquarters on the secret island! The cell is claustrophobic, with rusty iron bars and a bed of concrete.<br/><br/>
>In this challenge, you have to find the hidden flag. Good luck!
