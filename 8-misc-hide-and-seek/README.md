# Challenge #8 - Hide and Seek

Category: `misc`

## Story

>You arrive at the location through the coordinates that you got from the assassin, a luxurious yacht. A fat, bald man lies on a puma couch. He sips on a dry martini, smokes the biggest cigar you've ever seen and when he smiles, a golden tooth is revealed. You can’t help but smile back at him, although you think the place seems shady. "Welcome to my yacht, Johnson, finally you show us your face. Have you killed the AGENT now? Good! You’re here to collect your reward I presume? I’ll have my guy finalize the transaction but before you leave I need a small favour from you." It seems that he is mistaking you for the assassin but you don’t mind.<br/><br/>
>The man hands you a pendrive which you reluctantly connect to your laptop. He says he got it from a partner, and the partner claims that he hid valuable information in that PNG there. The problem is, it looks empty. See if you can find anything.
