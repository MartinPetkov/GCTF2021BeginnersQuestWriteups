I made a super secret encoder. I remember using:
- a weird base, much higher than base64
- a language named after a painter
- a language that is the opposite of good
- a language that looks like a rainbow cat
- a language that is too vulgar to write here
- a language that ended in 'ary' but I don't remember the full name

I also use gzip and zlib (to compress the stuff) and I like hiding things in files...
