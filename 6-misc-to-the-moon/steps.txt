Solution
1. base65536 decode
2. Convert to .jpg, run exif in CyberChef and extract the "Artist" tag (don't use the exif command line tool, it DOES NOT extract the full string)
3. Run by compiling http://web.archive.org/web/20070906133127/http://www1.pacific.edu/~twrensch/evil/evil.java via https://www.jdoodle.com/online-java-compiler/
4. Unhex it via CyberChef
5. Un-zlib it, can do `pigz -d <chall.zlib >chall.gz`
6. Un-gzip it with `gunzip chall.gz`
7. Treat the resulting file as a Piet program, running it via https://github.com/jdherg/pyet, this outputs hex
8. Un-hex it, this gives a zlib file
9. Un-zlib it, this gives a file in https://esolangs.org/wiki/Nya~
10. Run it via https://github.com/MichDem/Nya
11. Convert it to base8 via CyberChef
12. Treat that as brainfuck by converting according to https://esolangs.org/wiki/A
