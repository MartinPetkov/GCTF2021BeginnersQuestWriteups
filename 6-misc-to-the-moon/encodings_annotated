I made a super secret encoder. I remember using:
x a weird base, much higher than base64
  * base65536

x a language named after a painter
  * Piet
  * https://www.bertnase.de/npiet/npiet-execute.php

x a language that is the opposite of good
  * https://esolangs.org/wiki/Evil

x I also use gzip and zlib (to compress the stuff) and I like hiding things in files...

x a language that looks like a rainbow cat
  * It's this: https://esolangs.org/wiki/Nya~

- a language that is too vulgar to write here
  * brainfuck

- a language that ended in 'ary' but I don't remember the full name
  * Unary
